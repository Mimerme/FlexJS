Run with

```
node newFlex
```

Honestly pretty broken, but it works. When you type in the console nothing will appear (weird issue with nodejs prompt module). It will prompt and just don't mess up typing the answers. BTW ctrl-C doesn't work.

Great for generating quick small project sites.
